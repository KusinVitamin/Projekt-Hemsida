# Automatic Lab Grader

### What is it?

This is a project for the LTU course D0020E where we were assigned to create a solution for automatic grading of labs in courses, with initial focus on the course D0011E. Students can submit their assignments to a Canvas-like website, which will then be uploaded and automatically graded in a docker container. The student then recieves feedback based on the success or failure of the submission.
